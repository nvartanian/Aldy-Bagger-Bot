Initial Scope/Idea:
Bagging groceries at Aldi is one of the most stressful (and dangerous ðŸ˜‰) situations the everyday person finds themselves in.... The Aldy collects items slid/thrown into a bagging area and using computer vision to identify shape and orientation of each item. The robot then collects and places each item into a bag. With possible further development into sorting objects and ensuring heavy items are not placed on top of fragile items. As well as recognise barcodes and scanning item before placing them into a bag.

We plan to design a 5 DOF robot that will probably be made up of 2 universal joints and a single revolute joint. It will be optimised for faster movements (than the ur3) with medium payloads (max ~2.5kg) when compared to other collaborative robots. The robot wonâ€™t need to be able to orient itâ€™s gripper vertically upwards as all of the items will be picked up off a flat surface and dropped/placed into a bag. The gripper will also be designed to work effectively for a large range of object sizes and shapes.
